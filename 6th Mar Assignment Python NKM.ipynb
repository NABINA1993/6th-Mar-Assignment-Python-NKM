This type of statistics is used to describe and summarize data in a meaningful way, such as calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) or measures of variability (standard deviation, range). Examples of when descriptive statistics might be used include:\n",
    "A company collects data on the salaries of its employees and uses descriptive statistics to calculate the average salary, median salary, and range of salaries to better understand the compensation structure of the organization.\n",

    "A hospital collects data on the blood pressure of patients and uses descriptive statistics to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of blood pressure readings to identify patterns in patient health.\n",

    "Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics involves using data from a sample to make inferences about a larger population. This type of statistics is used to make predictions or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. Examples of when inferential statistics might be used include:\n",

    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. The mode is used to describe the most common value in a dataset, and it is particularly useful when the data is categorical or nominal.\n",

    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. The range is used to describe the spread of a dataset, and it is particularly useful when the data has a limited range.\n",

    "Variance: The variance is a measure of the spread of a dataset and is calculated by averaging the squared differences between each value and the mean. The variance is useful when analyzing datasets with significant variability, but it can be sensitive to outliers.\n",
